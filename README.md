Chromagotchi!!!

The Chromagotchi is a chrome extension, which is essentially a HTML page that runs in the background. Tamagotchi was a popular digital pet during the turning of the century, and Google's browser, Chrome, has been gaining popularity among internet users for its powerful extension applications. As a retro application that elicits childhood memories, Chromagotchi is a similar version of Tamagotchi but lives in your chrome browser. You can feed, clean, and pet your favorite childhood digital pet in your own browser.
